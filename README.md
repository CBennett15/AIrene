# AIrene

Front end to our final project, completed as part of the intensive full time Developer Pathway course at Northcoders in Manchester between February 2019 - May 2019.

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices written in Dart using Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab) framework.

## About AIrene

AIrene is an app that promotes positive mental wellbeing, with a machine-learning chatbot being its main feature. Users can interact with the chatbot and it will record moods, activities and achievements, and can even tell a joke or too. It will also pick up on worrying language and direct the user to mental health services if needed.

Other features include a calendar, a chart to record mood over time, a breathing app and links to useful resources.
